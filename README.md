The website is a health assistant website that will assist in bringing doctors together, with their patients.

This will enable the patienets to know when their personal doctors are available for them thus reducing the time 
many patients spend waiting for doctors to serve them in the health clinics. 

The website will also reduce the travelling practices that happen whenever patients need scans an have to wait for 
results after tests eg. for ulcers. Through the website, data can be sent to relevant patietnts where travels are reduced
thus reduced carbon monoxide emmisions from vehicles.

Dental,Surgery and pediatric doctors have a platform where they can show when they have no much work (through website notifications) 
thus the patients can contact them for some consultations without having to travel. This miight reduce the time consumed in travellig 
and queueing, and also creates accuracy of getting in touch with the doctors without much struggle.

In future if the startegy will be put in place, there will be implementation of cognitive IBM services to enable clearer pictures of wounds and sugeries from patient to doctors for advices on how best best to nurse themselves without having to travel to hospitals. (THIS BEST SUITS FRACTURED AND PATIENTS WHO REQUIRE RE-DRESSSING OF THEIR WOUNDS AFTER SUGERIES)

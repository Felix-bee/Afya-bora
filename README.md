The website is a health assistant website that will assist in bringing doctors together, with their patients.

Problem to be solved: /
The website is trying to solve the problem of having to travel from hospital to another in search of better services and also the problem of queueing and waiting for doctors long enough to be treated. The website will have ratings and feedbacks from the patients treated in a certain hospital where a patient gets to choose the well rated and available doctor at the moment.
Also trying to reduce time wasted during waiting for results after scans, which will improve the economy as people will continue working awaiting results from the websites at the comfort of their homes or offices.

Websiteâ€™s description: /
The website alerts will enable the patients to know when their personal doctors are available for them thus reducing the time many patients spend waiting for doctors to serve them in the health clinics.
The website will also reduce the travelling practices that happen whenever patients need scans an have to wait for results after tests eg. for ulcers. Through the website, data can be sent to relevant patients where travels are reduced thus reduced carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles.
Dental, Surgery and pediatric doctors have a platform where they can show when they have no much work (through website notifications) thus the patients can contact them for some consultations without having to travel. This might reduce the time consumed in travelling and queueing, and also creates accuracy of getting in touch with the doctors without much struggle.

What the website can do for now: /
The website has an interactive user interface that welcomes the user to the page and website. It tells the user what is entailed within the website and where to find whatever he or she wants to be familiar with in the website. Has also a section to leave feedbacks after using the website to enable the website maintainers know what and where to improve.

IBM service used or to be used: /
In future if the strategy will be put in place, there will be implementation of cognitive IBM services to enable clearer pictures of wounds and surgeries from patient to doctors for advices on how best to nurse themselves without having to travel to hospitals, through video calls such as skype or zoom meet. (THIS BEST SUITS FRACTURED PATIENTS AND PATIENTS WHO REQUIRE RE-DRESSSING OF THEIR WOUNDS AFTER SUGERIES)
